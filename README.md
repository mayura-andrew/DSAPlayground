# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This codebase is dedicated to implementing various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Data Structures

The codebase includes implementations of commonly used data structures such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Algorithms

In addition to data structures, this codebase also covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms
- And more!

The implementations are designed to be clear, concise, and efficient, providing you with a solid foundation in algorithmic problem-solving.

## How to Use

To get started, navigate to the respective directories for data structures or algorithms that you are interested in. Each directory contains the source code files along with accompanying documentation and examples.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms in the C language.
