        "**Lexical Scope**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lexical scope is a fundamental concept in programming languages that determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within a program. It refers to the area where an item (such as a function or variable) is defined and accessible to other code. In other words, lexical scope is the definition area of an expression, which is the place where the item was created[1][2][4].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python\n",
        "In Python, lexical scope is implemented using a concept called \"dynamic scoping.\" This means that the scope of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time. Variables are looked up in the current scope and then in the parent scopes until the global scope is reached. This allows for nested functions to access variables from their outer scopes[2][5].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Go\n",
        "In Go, lexical scope is implemented using a concept called \"lexical scoping.\" This means that the scope of a variable is determined at compile time, not at runtime. Variables are looked up in the current scope and then in the parent scopes until the global scope is reached. This allows for nested functions to access variables from their outer scopes, but Go does not support hoisting like JavaScript does[2][5].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "- **Lexical scope** refers to the area where an item is defined and accessible to other code.\n",
        "- **Scope chain** refers to the unique spaces that exist from the scope where a variable was called to the global scope.\n",
        "- **Lexical** refers to the definition of things, such as creating words, expressions, or variables.\n",
        "- **Static scope** is another name for lexical scope, indicating that the scope is determined at compile time.\n",
        "- **Dynamic scope** is the opposite of lexical scope, where the scope is determined at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Examples\n",
        "- **Python**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def outer():\n",
        "      x = 1\n",
        "      def inner():\n",
        "          print(x)\n",
        "      inner()\n",
        "  outer()\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  In this example, `inner` can access `x` from its outer scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Go**:\n",
        "  ```go\n",
        "  package main\n",
        "\n",
        "  import \"fmt\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  func main() {\n",
        "      var a int = 1\n",
        "      func inner() {\n",
        "          fmt.Println(a)\n",
        "      }\n",
        "      inner()\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  In this example, `inner` can access `a` from its outer scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "Lexical scope is a crucial concept in programming languages that determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within a program. Python and Go both implement lexical scope, but with different approaches. Understanding lexical scope is essential for writing efficient and effective code in these languages.\n",
