# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This codebase is dedicated to implementing various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Data Structures

The codebase includes implementations of commonly used data structures such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each data structure is accompanied by detailed explanations and examples to help you understand their usage and performance characteristics.

## Algorithms

In addition to data structures, this codebase also covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms
- And more!

The implementations are designed to be clear, concise, and efficient, providing you with a solid foundation in algorithmic problem-solving.

## How to Use

To get started, navigate to the respective directories for data structures or algorithms that you are interested in. Each directory contains the C source code files along with accompanying documentation and examples.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms in the C language.

Happy coding!
