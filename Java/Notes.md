# Notes 


## Array

**Disadvantages**

- In unordered array -> searching is slow, 
- Ordered array -> insertion is slow
- in both kinds of arrays, deletion is slow.
- the size of array can't be changed after it's created.

## Linked-List 

- in linked-list, each data item is embedded in a link. 
- each link object contains a reference (usually called next) to the next link in the list.
-  ```java
class Link {
    public int iData; // data
    public double dData; // data
    public Link next; // reference to next link
}
```
